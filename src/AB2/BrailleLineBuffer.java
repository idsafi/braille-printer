 * <p>The class contains a buffer for a sequence of monospaced Braille character bitmaps (see {@code class BrailleFont}
 * for details on the bitmaps), as much as methods to manipulate this buffer. Character sequence within the buffer are
 * continuous, so it must not contain any 'holes' (e.g. null values) between the bitmaps. Remark: White spaces
 * are valid characters and are not considered 'holes'.</p>
 *
 * <p>The buffer is initialized with a start size, but can grow while adding and shrink while deleting characters.
 * It can not grow while deleting, and shrink wile adding characters.</p>
