 * <p>This class provides methods for printing Braille characters and strings, both specified by corresponding
 * ASCII characters. All print operations at character level are delegated to the line buffer.</p>
 * <p>The line buffer can also be modified by inserting and deleting characters at specified positions.
 * It can be sent to the system's standard output (console) at any time by calling the {@code flush()} method,
